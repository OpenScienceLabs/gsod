# Google Season of Docs 2024 Proposal for Open Science Labs

Open Science Labs (OSL) actively supports open-source development, and the
principles of open science. Our Incubator Program aids in the development of
open-source projects and a plethora of processes to benefit the community across
various disciplines. We strongly believe that effective documentation is
essential for success and expansion. Therefore, participating in the Google
Season of Docs, will enable us to enhance our documentation quality. In turn,
making our projects more user-friendly and easier to contribute to. It is our
priority to achieve enhanced documentation processes, following with the
integration to all new projects. These improved documentation standards will
shape a project template named “SciCookie”.

## About Open Science Labs

OSL is dedicated to advancing scientific research through collaboration,
innovation, and education. Our mission is to foster a more inclusive,
transparent, and accessible scientific community; empowering researchers,
educators, and students to contribute significantly towards scientific
advancements. OSL encourages partnership, modernization, and learning within the
scientific community. Thus, OSL offers Project Incubation, Partnerships, and an
Internship Program to rising talents, all while upholding the principles of
openness and accessibility.

## About the Project

### Project's Problem

Maintaining high-quality documentation is challenging, especially when
initiating a new project and establishing its foundational documentation
structure. SciCookie, leveraging cookieninja (a cookiecutter fork) as its
backend, facilitates the creation of a robust initial structure for new
projects. It incorporates recommendations from pyOpenSci to optimize the project
template, encouraging adherence to best practices from the outset. However,
SciCookie's current documentation structure is rather simplistic. Undoubtedly,
here's a clear need for guidelines. These contributions would assist writers and
boost quality and effectiveness.

### Project's Scope

This project aims to develop comprehensive guidelines for all documentation and
evidence recording. Moreover, the scope would include structural refining of the
existing SciCookie template. Once OSL applies these guidelines to at least one
Incubator Project, (as a pilot to validate the recommendations), the process
would be complete.

#### Deliverables

1. **Documentation Guideline**: Establish guidelines for creating effective and
   comprehensive documentation for Python projects.
2. **mkdocs Guideline**: Formulate specific recommendations for using mkdocs
   with material, including configuring menus, sub-menus, table of contents, and
   blog posts.
3. **Pilot Project Implementation**: Apply both sets of guidelines to a selected
   incubator project as a practical implementation test.
4. **Update SciCookie**: Integrate these guidelines into the SciCookie template.

## Measuring Success

Success will be evaluated through a Google Forms survey, seeking feedback on the
ongoing work. We aim for at least 75% positive feedback, focusing on content
quality, information completeness, documentation aesthetics, and functionality.

## Requirements

### Technical Writer

**Required**:

- Proficient in English
- Experienced in documentation organization
- Able to communicate with community members
- Comfortable with Git, GitHub, and pull request workflows
- Familiarity with Python and mkdocs

## Volunteers

@xmnlab - Ivan, the main point of contact, has contributed extensively to
documentation and setup for incubator projects.

@bluexblooded - Victoria is a professional writer experienced in covering a wide
variety of topics.

## Timeline

The project span is 6 months; from May to November 2024. This timeline considers
the existence of a dedicated technical writer working an average of 10 hours per
week. Activities include participating in community meetings, and promoting OSL
projects.
