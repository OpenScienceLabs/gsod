## Introduction

Open Science Labs (OSL) seeks to participate in the Google Season of Docs 2024 with a project that aims to standardize and enhance the documentation practices for Python projects within the OSL Incubator Program and new projects created with SciCookie. Our project focuses on the development of comprehensive guidelines for documentation and a definition of recommendation for configuring the documentation with mkdocs. This guidelines should be applied to a set of few projects under of the OSL Incubator Program and the template in SciCookie (a project generator from template) should be updated using these new documentation guideline and mkdocs new configuration.

## Project Goals
1. **Develop Documentation Guidelines**: Create a set of guidelines for writing effective and comprehensive documentation for Python projects, with a special emphasis on the use of mkdocs.
2. **Establish a Mkdocs Boilerplate**: Define a standard configuration and structure for mkdocs that can be recommended for use across all projects under the OSL Incubator Program.
3. **Pilot Project Implementation**: Apply the developed mkdocs guidelines and boilerplate to a selection of incubator projects, serving as pilot implementations.
4. **Update SciCookie**: SciCookie is a project generator, and updating the predefined mkdocs configuration into SciCookie template will help new projects created by SciCookie to have a better shape and use best-practice about documentation and mkdocs. Additionally, the guideline for documentation should be added to the SciCookie Template.

## Background
Open Science Labs has been working promoting open-source development and open science principles. Through our Incubator Program, we support the development of innovative open source projects that contribute the community in different areas. Effective documentation is crucial for the success and adoption of these projects. By participating in Google Season of Docs, we aim to elevate our documentation standards, making our projects more accessible and easier to contribute to.

## Expected Outcomes
- A comprehensive guide for writing documentation for Python projects, optimized for mkdocs.
- A mkdocs boilerplate that encapsulates best practices in documentation structure and configuration.
- Enhanced documentation for selected OSL Incubator Program projects, demonstrating the practical application of our guidelines.
- Increased engagement from the open-source community, facilitated by clearer and more accessible project documentation.
- Update the SciCookie template with the standards and developed guidlines.

## Why Google Season of Docs?
Participating in Google Season of Docs aligns with our mission to enhance the quality and accessibility of project documentation within the open-source and scientific communities. The support and visibility offered by Google Season of Docs will enable us to collaborate with skilled technical writers, furthering our goals of promoting best practices in documentation and contributing to the overall quality of open-source projects.
