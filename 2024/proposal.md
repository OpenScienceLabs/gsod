# Google Season of Docs 2024 Proposal for Open Science Labs

## Introduction

**Open Science Labs (OSL)** is at the forefront of advancing scientific research
through collaboration, innovation, and education. With a mission centered on
creating a more inclusive, transparent, and accessible scientific community, OSL
aims to empower researchers, educators, and students to contribute meaningfully
to the progress of science. Through initiatives such as project incubation,
partnership facilitation, internship programs, and OpenHub, OSL provides a
platform for collaboration, innovation, and learning within the scientific
community. Guided by the principles of collaboration, innovation, and openness,
OSL is committed to providing the necessary tools, resources, and support to
advance science and technology in an open and accessible manner. Join OSL in its
mission to foster a future where knowledge is freely shared, driving innovation
and progress for all.

## Project Goals

1. **Develop Documentation Guidelines**: Create a set of guidelines for writing
   effective and comprehensive documentation for Python projects, with a special
   emphasis on the use of mkdocs.
2. **Establish a Mkdocs Initial Structure**: Define a standard configuration and
   structure for mkdocs that can be recommended for use across all projects
   under the OSL Incubator Program.
3. **Pilot Project Implementation**: Apply the developed mkdocs guidelines and
   boilerplate to a selection of incubator projects, serving as pilot
   implementations.
4. **Update SciCookie**: SciCookie is a project generator, and updating the
   predefined mkdocs configuration into SciCookie template will help new
   projects created by SciCookie to have a better shape and use best-practice
   about documentation and mkdocs. Additionally, the guideline for documentation
   should be added to the SciCookie Template.

## Background

Open Science Labs has been working promoting open-source development and open
science principles. Through our Incubator Program, we support the development of
innovative open source projects that contribute the community in different
areas. Effective documentation is crucial for the success and adoption of these
projects. By participating in Google Season of Docs, we aim to elevate our
documentation standards, making our projects more accessible and easier to
contribute to.

## Expected Outcomes

- A comprehensive guide for writing documentation for Python projects, optimized
  for mkdocs.
- A mkdocs boilerplate that encapsulates best practices in documentation
  structure and configuration.
- Enhanced documentation for selected OSL Incubator Program projects,
  demonstrating the practical application of our guidelines.
- Increased engagement from the open-source community, facilitated by clearer
  and more accessible project documentation.
- Update the SciCookie template with the standards and developed guidelines.

## Why Google Season of Docs?

Participating in Google Season of Docs aligns with our mission to enhance the
quality and accessibility of project documentation within the open-source and
scientific communities. The support and visibility offered by Google Season of
Docs will enable us to collaborate with skilled technical writers, furthering
our goals of promoting best practices in documentation and contributing to the
overall quality of open-source projects.

| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| May       | Orientation: get to know the team. Familiarize yourself with Open Science Labs/website code and documentation structure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| June      | Review navigation of docs of other Open Source projects. Draft a new proposal for the docs structure ([statement of interest](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-statement)). Create a PR, ask the team and community for feedback. First monthly evaluation period                                                                                 |
| July      | Finish navigation, test redirects and see if there are broken links. Talk to the OSL team to figure out contention points and common questions of new users. Review flow of "docs". Second monthly evaluation period                                                                                                                                                           |
| August    | Analyse the project "docs". Create a plan for where core concepts should go into more detail. Work with OSL maintainers and contributors to enhance the core concepts documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| September | Integrate work and ask for feedback from the community. Celebrate success so far - get a nice blog post on the website! Third monthly evaluation period                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| October   | Review overlap between Install docs, and use-cases. Compared with other projects. (Hopefully with what's been done in June, it will be easier to distinguish Day 1 from Day 2 tasks.) If there is a lot more work to be done to e.g. break up pieces into "tasks", maybe focus on low-hanging fruit instead. Ask for feedback again, publish. Fourth monthly evaluation period |
| November  | Tidy up loose ends. Celebrate with another blog post on the website!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
