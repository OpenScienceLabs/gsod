# Google Season of Docs 2024 Proposal for Open Science Labs

Open Science Labs (OSL) actively supports open-source development and the
principles of open science through our Incubator Program. This program aids in
the development of open-source projects that benefit the community across
various domains. We recognize that effective documentation is essential for the
success and wider adoption of these projects. Participating in the Google Season
of Docs will enable us to enhance our documentation quality, making our projects
more user-friendly and easier to contribute to. Our ultimate goal is to
incorporate this enhanced documentation approach into a project template, named
SciCookie, ensuring that all new projects initiated with it will embody these
improved documentation standards.

## About Open Science Labs

OSL is dedicated to advancing scientific research through collaboration,
innovation, and education. Our mission is to foster a more inclusive,
transparent, and accessible scientific community, empowering researchers,
educators, and students to contribute significantly to scientific advancements.
OSL encourages collaboration, innovation, and learning within the scientific
community through project incubation, partnerships, and an Internship Program,
all while upholding the principles of openness and accessibility.

## About the Project

### Project's Problem

Maintaining high-quality documentation is challenging, especially when
initiating a new project and establishing its foundational documentation
structure.

SciCookie, leveraging cookieninja (a cookiecutter fork) as its backend,
facilitates the creation of a robust initial structure for new projects. It
incorporates recommendations from pyOpenSci to optimize the project template,
encouraging adherence to best practices from the outset. However, SciCookie's
current documentation structure is basic, and there's a clear need for
guidelines that can assist documentation writers in enhancing documentation
quality and effectiveness.

### Project's Scope

This project aims to develop a comprehensive guideline for documentation and
refine the initial structure provided by the SciCookie template. It will also
involve applying these guidelines to at least one OSL Incubator project as a
pilot to validate the recommendations.

#### Deliverables

1. **Documentation Guideline**: Establish guidelines for creating effective and
   comprehensive documentation for Python projects.
2. **mkdocs Guideline**: Formulate specific recommendations for using mkdocs
   with material, including configuring menus, sub-menus, table of contents, and
   blog posts.
3. **Pilot Project Implementation**: Apply both sets of guidelines to a selected
   incubator project as a practical implementation test.
4. **Update SciCookie**: Integrate these guidelines into the SciCookie template.

## Measuring Success

Success will be evaluated through a Google Forms survey, seeking feedback on the
ongoing work. We aim for at least 75% positive feedback, focusing on content
quality, information completeness, and documentation aesthetics and
functionality.

## Requirements

### Technical Writer

**Required**:

- Proficient in English
- Experienced in documentation organization
- Able to communicate with community members
- Comfortable with Git, GitHub, and pull request workflows
- Familiarity with Python and mkdocs

## Volunteers

@xmnlab - Ivan, the main point of contact, has contributed extensively to
documentation and setup for incubator projects.

An additional volunteer will be recruited to assist in guiding the project and
verifying the outcomes.

## Timeline

The project spans 6 months, from May to November 2024, with the technical writer
dedicating an average of 10 hours per week. Activities include participating in
community meetings and promoting the project.
