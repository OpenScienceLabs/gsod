# Google Season of Docs 2024 Proposal for Open Science Labs

Open Science Labs has been working promoting open-source development and open
science principles. Through our Incubator Program, we support the development of
innovative open source projects that contribute the community in different
areas. Effective documentation is crucial for the success and adoption of these
projects. By participating in Google Season of Docs, we aim to elevate our
documentation standards, making our projects more accessible and easier to
contribute to. As a final deliverable, this knowledge and best-practices
standards will be compiled into a project template project, SciCookie, so any
new project created with that will automatically use this new structure.

## About Open Science Labs

**Open Science Labs (OSL)** is at the forefront of advancing scientific research
through collaboration, innovation, and education. With a mission centered on
creating a more inclusive, transparent, and accessible scientific community, OSL
aims to empower researchers, educators, and students to contribute meaningfully
to the progress of science. Through initiatives such as project incubation,
partnership, and Internship Program, OSL provides a platform for collaboration,
innovation, and learning within the scientific community. Guided by the
principles of collaboration, innovation, and openness, OSL is committed to
providing the necessary tools, resources, and support to advance science and
technology in an open and accessible manner.

## About the project

### Project's problem

TBD

### Project's Scope

1. **Develop Documentation Guidelines**: Create a set of guidelines for writing
   effective and comprehensive documentation for Python projects, with a special
   emphasis on the use of mkdocs.
2. **Establish a Mkdocs Initial Structure**: Define a standard configuration and
   structure for mkdocs that can be recommended for use across all projects
   under the OSL Incubator Program.
3. **Pilot Project Implementation**: Apply the developed mkdocs guidelines and
   boilerplate to a selection of incubator projects, serving as pilot
   implementations.
4. **Update SciCookie**: SciCookie is a project generator, and updating the
   predefined mkdocs configuration into SciCookie template will help new
   projects created by SciCookie to have a better shape and use best-practice
   about documentation and mkdocs. Additionally, the guideline for documentation
   should be added to the SciCookie Template.

### Expected Outcomes

- A comprehensive guide for writing documentation for Python projects, optimized
  for mkdocs.
- A mkdocs boilerplate that encapsulates best practices in documentation
  structure and configuration.
- Enhanced documentation for selected OSL Incubator Program projects,
  demonstrating the practical application of our guidelines.
- Increased engagement from the open-source community, facilitated by clearer
  and more accessible project documentation.
- Update the SciCookie template with the standards and developed guidelines.

## How would we measure success?

We plan to publish a survey on google-forms and ask a few questions about work
that will be in progress. The feedback we will be used to improve the results.

At the end, it would be expected to have at least 75% of good feedback from the
survey.

The questions will be focused on the quality of content, if there are any
missing information, and the aesthetical and functional, accessibility aspect of
the documentation page.

## Requirements

### Requirements for technical writer

Required:

- Proficiency in written English
- Experience with documentation organization or information architecture
- Communicating with community members
- Comfortable with Git, Github and pull request-driven workflows

Nice to have:

- Knowledge about Python, and mkdocs

### For Web Dev (?)

TBD

## Volunteers

@xmnlab - Main point of contact. Ivan has been contributing to the projects on
the OSL Incubator Program, and have helped writing documentation and
configuration the documentation engine for all the projects in incubation.

## Timeline

We expect that the technical writer will spend 6 months on the project, between
May and November 2024, working 10 hours per week on average. During these hours,
the technical writer will also:

- Attend OSL community meetings, specific for documentation
- Publish and spread awareness of the project

| June      | Review navigation of docs of other Open Source projects. Draft a new proposal for the docs structure ([statement of interest](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-statement)). Create a PR, ask the team and community for feedback. First monthly evaluation period                                                                                 |
| July      | Finish navigation, test redirects and see if there are broken links. Talk to the OSL team to figure out contention points and common questions of new users. Review flow of "docs". Second monthly evaluation period                                                                                                                                                           |
| August    | Analyse the project "docs". Create a plan for where core concepts should go into more detail. Work with OSL maintainers and contributors to enhance the core concepts documentation.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| September | Integrate work and ask for feedback from the community. Celebrate success so far - get a nice blog post on the website! Third monthly evaluation period                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| October   | Review overlap between Install docs, and use-cases. Compared with other projects. (Hopefully with what's been done in June, it will be easier to distinguish Day 1 from Day 2 tasks.) If there is a lot more work to be done to e.g. break up pieces into "tasks", maybe focus on low-hanging fruit instead. Ask for feedback again, publish. Fourth monthly evaluation period |
| November  | Tidy up loose ends. Celebrate with another blog post on the website!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
